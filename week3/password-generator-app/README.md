**To do this challenge, you need a strong understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.**

## The challenge

Your challenge is to build out this password generator app and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

Your users should be able to:

- Generate a password based on the selected inclusion options
- Copy the generated password to the computer's clipboard
- See a strength rating for their generated password
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## Where to find everything

Your task is to build out the project to the design file provided. We provide both Sketch and Figma versions of the design, so you can choose which tool you prefer to use. You can download the design file on the platform. **Please be sure not to share them with anyone else.** The design download comes with a `README.md` file as well to help you get set up.

All the required assets for this project are in the `/assets` folder. The images are already exported for the correct screen size and optimized. Some are reusable at multiple screen sizes. So if you don't see an image in a specific folder, it will typically be in another folder for that page.

We also include variable and static font files for the required fonts for this project. You can choose to either link to Google Fonts or use the local font files to host the fonts yourself. Note that we've removed the static font files for the font weights that aren't needed for this project.

The design system in the design file will give you more information about the various colors, fonts, and styles used in this project. Our fonts always come from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/).

## Building your project

Feel free to use any workflow that you feel comfortable with. Below is a suggested process, but do not feel like you need to follow these steps:

1. Separate the `starter-code` from the rest of this project and rename it to something meaningful for you. Initialize the codebase as a public repository on [GitHub](https://github.com/). Creating a repo will make it easier to share your code with the community if you need help. If you're not sure how to do this, [have a read-through of this Try Git resource](https://try.github.io/). **‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT ‚ö†Ô∏è: There are already a couple of `.gitignore` files in this project. Please do not remove them or change the content of the files. If you create a brand new project, please use the `.gitignore` files provided in your new codebase. This is to avoid the accidental upload of the design files to GitHub. With these premium challenges, please be sure not to share the design files in your GitHub repo. Thanks!**
2. Configure your repository to publish your code to a web address. This will also be useful if you need some help during a challenge as you can share the URL for your project with your repo URL. There are a number of ways to do this, and we provide some recommendations below.
3. Look through the designs to start planning out how you'll tackle the project. This step is crucial to help you think ahead for CSS classes to create reusable styles.
4. Before adding any styles, structure your content with HTML. Writing your HTML first can help focus your attention on creating well-structured content.
5. Write out the base styles for your project, including general content styles, such as `font-family` and `font-size`.
6. Start adding styles to the top of the page and work down. Only move on to the next section once you're happy you've completed the area you're working on.
